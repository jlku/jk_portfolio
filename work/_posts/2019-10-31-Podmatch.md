overview:
    - It is difficult for independent podcast producers to grow their audiences. Unlike large studios, they don't have the benefit of promoting their shows on already-successful shows.  
    - With Podmatch, producers are able to grow their audiences by finding partners for ad swaps, episode swaps and more.
outcome:
    - This version of Podmatch proved that independent producers want to swap ads with similar shows. However, I still need to rework the ad swap process. 
tools:
    - Django, Sketch, Bootstrap, Scrapy, HTML, CSS
