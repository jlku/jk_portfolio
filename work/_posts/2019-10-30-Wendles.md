overview:
    - The last thing many busy commuters want to think about is lunch or dinner. Although food delivery services are convenient, users are often handcuffed to a set location while waiting for their food.
    - Mr. Wendles aims to streamline meals by meeting people where they already are. Instead of low-quality or slow meals that commuters find around transit hubs, Mr. Wendles aims to offer healthy and affordable options for commuters on the go.
